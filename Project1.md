Overview
=========

In this project you will set up a development environment (using
Docker, Python, Django and MySQL) and then create a simple Hello World
app in Django. Whew!

There's a lot of Linux and system level stuff in this project. It may
seem like you don't need to know all of this, but you do. :) Don't just
type the commands that apear here. Understand what's going on and only
use these instructions as a hint.

This is probably the most involved project in the course. If you get
stuck, don't get demoralized. Ask the instructor or the TA's for help!

Linux
-----

You will need some basic knowledge of Linux and sys admin
knowledge. You'll be doing basic things like install new software,
running SSH, looking at Apache log files, etc. While you don't need to
be a shell scripting god you should also be able to get the gist of a
script if need be.

If you want a reference with additional commands, we're going to
consistently update this document with common questions.

Containers
----------

Docker is a system for managing Linux containers. You can read more
about them elsewhere, but they're like a virtual machione but lighter
weight. They're one component of treating infrastructure as
software. You can define what kind of environment you need, install
apps, define networking topologies, and then easily clone/start as
many instances of that container as you like -- on your dev machine or
on public hosting providers like Amazon AWS.

You'll be using two containers initially -- one that contains an
Apache/Django installation and another that contains MySQL.

The system for containers we're using requires Linux. If you're
already running Linux on your laptop then you will likely need to just
install Docker. If you're using a Mac or Windows, you will need to
install the special Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows packages (see
below).

Note, when you're using the Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows
packages you're still using Linux. These packages install a
lightweight virtual machine and Linux installation. They manage all of
this for you so you don't even notice that you're running Linux on
your Mac or Windows machine.

Django
------

You should already be familiar with Python and Django. If not, go read more
here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/. We highly recommend that you
work through the example application in the Django tutorial if this is your
first experience with Django.

MySQL
-----

The database used in this class will be MySQL. It's a very common SQL
database. You can read more at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index.html.

You will not need detailed knowledge of SQL for this class, but you
should be familiar with the concepts involved of tables, queries,
updates, etc.

        tp@devel:~$

- Initialize the MySQL `db` docker image (NOTE: you MUST use the password specified here):

        tp@devel:~$ mkdir ~/cs4501/db
        tp@devel:~$ docker run --name mysql -d -e MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD='$3cureUS' -v ~/cs4501/db:/var/lib/mysql  mysql:5.7.14
        79c856338ace5edc9df074e252fb16caedd0ed1b53f64eef613e84301482dd75

- Note the status of your Docker containers. The one named `web` will be shown as
  exited while the one named `mysql` will be running.

        tp@devel:~$ docker ps -a
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES

        tp@devel:~$

Congratulations -- you now have two containers running, one for
running Django web apps and the other for running MySQL.

Setting up MySQL
----------------

Now it's time to create the user and database in MySQL for your
app. You'll use the MySQL command line client to do
this. Conveniently, that's installed in the MySQL image you've already
got. You'll just need to start a NEW container running that image and
use it to connect to the first MySQL container image you're already
running.

    tp@devel:~$ docker run -it --name mysql-cmdline --link mysql:db mysql:5.7.14 bash
    # mysql -uroot -p'$3cureUS' -h db
    mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 2
    Server version: 5.7.14-rc MySQL Community Server (GPL)

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2015, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

    mysql>

You're logged in as root now and should create a non-root user that
your app will use. It's always best to use the least privileges
possible so we'll only give this new user access to the tables
required for this app and no other privileges.

    mysql> create user 'www'@'%' identified by '$3cureUS';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> create database cs4501 character set utf8;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all on cs4501.* to 'www'@'%';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> ^DBye

(hit Ctrl-D at the `mysql>` prompt to exit the MySQL shell).

This will create a new MySQL user named `www` and a new databse named
`cs4501` (replace foo with the name of your project). www's password is
`$3cureUS`. Finally, this gives `www` access to all tables in `cs4501`.

You can keep this container around for easy access to the MySQL
command line.

Working with containers
-----------------------

Run `docker ps -a` and you'll see that you have two containers (the
ones you started above when testing your install) named `web` and
`mysql`. These are your dev environment containers. You'll do your
coding and initial testing in these containers. Run `docker rm web` to
clean up the (stopped) web container you started earlier when testing
your install. Go ahead and stop your mysql container with `docker stop
mysql`.

Docker provides a simple way for containers to talk to each other via
private networks. When you start a container you can tell Docker to
create an `/etc/hosts` entry for another running container. We'll do
this so that the web container can easily connect to the mysql
container. Let's restart the web container this way:

    tp@devel:~$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

    f34a25b95ffa        mysql:5.7.14         "/entrypoint.sh mysql"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   3306/tcp            mysql
    tp@devel:~$ docker run -it --name web --link mysql:db -v ~/cs4501/app:/app tp33/django
    root@1c359b81b84f:/app# ping db
    PING db (172.17.0.5): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 172.17.0.5: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.110 ms

    root@1c359b81b84f:/app# exit
    exit
    tp@devel:~$

This tells Docker to create a new container from the `tp33/django`
image and create a hosts entry named `db` that references the IP address
used by the mysql container.

When you exit a container it's disk image persists allowing you to
restart it later. You can re-start your web container with 'docker
start web' and then re-attach an interactive session to it with
`docker attach web`.

If you want to remove a container, use `docker rm`. If you want to
remove an image, use `docker rmi`. Once you remove a container, any
changes that you made inside of it are gone.

The way that you can persist data between container invocations is to
store the data outside the container and then make the data accessible
once the container starts. The simplest way to do this is to mount a
directory from outside the containers to a point inside the container.

The `-v` argument to `docker run` does exactly this. It takes two paths,
seperated by a colon. The first path is a directory on your
Mac/Windows/Linux system and the second path is a directory inside the
container. Any data stored or changed in this directory in the
container will really be getting stored outside the container and so
will persist beyond the container's lifetime.

Notice that when we started the `web` and `mysql` containers above we used
the `-v` argument to tell docker that we wanted to make data in our host
system mounted into the containers. We said that `/app` in the `web`
container should access data stored in the host's `~/cs4501/app` and the
`mysql` container should store its `/var/lib/mysql` data under the host's
`~/cs4501/db`.

Go ahead and try creating a file on your host in `~/cs4501/app` and then
verify that you can access that file inside your web container.

Development Environment
====================

Git
---

You'll use GitHub for version control. If you don't have a GitHub
account already, go create one. There's good online help for using
GitHub and Git.

Dev process
-------------

Generally, you will be editing your code in the host directory
`~/cs4501/app`, testing it inside your container and then when it's
complete you will check it into github from your host. This allows you
to edit using whatever IDE / editor you prefer on your Mac/Windows
laptop but run your code with a carefully configured system specified
inside your web container.

Making your own containers
---------------------------

You can create your down Docker images. The easiest way to do this is
to start with an existing container and make changes to it. For
example, maybe there are some Python libraries that you want to use
and which I didn't install in `tp33/django`. You could build your own
container that inherits from my container and then adds your Python
packages.

Each container's image is built according to instructions stored in a
Dockerfile. This is the list of commands required to install software
and configure your image. You can read more about the syntax of
Dockeriles on the Docker website.

The Dockerfile I used to create `tp33/django` is at
https:/github.com/thomaspinckney3/django-docker.

Code layout
-----------

Your Django app will go in `/app` in the web container, which is mounted
from `~/cs4501/app` in your host environment.

Inside your web container, create a new Django project with
`django-admin startproject foo` where foo is the name you want to give
your project.

On your host environment, edit the `~/cs4501/app/foo/foo/settings.py` file to point
to your database.

The `tp33/django` image already has the MySQL Python Connector installed
so use the engine `mysql.connector.django`. The `HOST` setting is `db`
as that's what we tell Docker to expose the `mysql` container's IP
address under in this container (via the `--link` argument when we
started this container). Set `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `NAME` to `www`,
`$3cureUS`, and `cs4501`. You must use these values in order to hook
into our grading systems later.

Again, note, you're creating / editting your code outside the
container in the host but running inside the container under `/app`.

Inside your web container:

    root@4ee80653d2be:/app# django-admin startproject foo

(but replace `foo` with the name of your project)

Back on your Mac/Windows shell:

    tp@devel:~$ cd ~/cs4501/app/foo/foo
    tp@devel:~/cs4501/app/foo/foo# vi settings.py
    tp@devel:~/cs4501/app/foo/foo# grep -A 10 -B 5 DATABASES settings.py
    # Database
    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#databases

    DATABASES = {
              'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'mysql.connector.django',
              'NAME': 'cs4501',
              'USER': 'www',
              'PASSWORD': '$3cureUS',
              'HOST': 'db',
              }
          }

    # Internationalization

Finally, commit and push your newly created Django app up to GitHub.

You should create an ssh key pair (`ssh key-gen`) and then upload your
public key to GitHub so you can push/pull changes without typing your
password each time.

In the future, when you want to deploy a test or production container
you can just use `docker run` to start an instance of `tp33/django`,
checkout your code from GitHub, and you're good to go.

Trying it all out
-----------------

If everything is working correctly, you can now go back to your web
container and try out some Django commands. Remember, `stuff` is the
name of my Django project but yours will be different below

    root@4ee80653d2be:~/app# cd stuff
    root@4ee80653d2be:~/app/stuff# python manage.py migrate
    Operations to perform:
    Apply all migrations: contenttypes, sessions, auth, admin
    Running migrations:
    Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
    Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
    Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
    Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
    root@4ee80653d2be:~/app/stuff#

If the `DATABASES` section is not set up correctly, or if the database
itself has a problem, you'll get an error here.

Now try running Apache. Your web container has Apache and `mod_wsgi`
installed already. Again, note `stuff` is my project name and you
will need to replace that with your project's name.

Inside your web container:

    root@399bd9c4a2a5:/app# mod_wsgi-express start-server --working-directory /app/stuff /app/stuff/stuff/wsgi.py &
    [1] 73
    Server URL         : http://localhost:8000/
    Server Root        : /tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8000:0
    Server Conf        : /tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8000:0/httpd.conf
    Error Log File     : /tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8000:0/error_log (warn)
    Request Capacity   : 5 (1 process * 5 threads)
    Request Timeout    : 60 (seconds)
    Queue Backlog      : 100 (connections)
    Queue Timeout      : 45 (seconds)
    Server Capacity    : 20 (event/worker), 20 (prefork)
    Server Backlog     : 500 (connections)
    Locale Setting     : en_US.UTF-8

And test it out:

    root@399bd9c4a2a5:/app/stuff# curl http://localhost:8000/

You should get back the stock Django "It worked" page. If you get any
other sort of response then something's not right.

`mod_wsgi-express` is a handy tool which generates an Apache `httpd.conf` file
for you and then starts Apache using that conf file. It prints out
some paths to where the `httpd.conf` file is and where the error log is. You
can read more at
http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2015/04/introducing-modwsgi-express.html.

`curl` is another handy tool. It is a command line tool for issuing
`HTTP GET` or `POST` commands. It's great for debugging web apps.

If you have trouble and need to debug your code there are two ways:
either use the Django development server or look in the Apache error
logs.  The Django development server prints exceptions to standard out
so it's easy to see when something is wrong. If you're using Apache,
the `mod_wsgi-express` command above printed out the path to the error
log -- it will be something like
`/tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8000:0/error_log`. Look there for exceptions or
other errors.

Hello World
===========

Next you're going to write a very simple
Django app. This assumes you're already familiar with the basics of
Django development. If not, now is a good time to review the Django
tutorial and docs. We're using version 1.8.x.

Create a very simple home page for your app. You should add an entry
to your `urls.py` that points to a view that you create in a new file
named `home.py`. You can return whatever you want, but whatever it is
should be rendered by a Django template.

Later on in the course we're going to be using the Bootstrap CSS
library. If you want to get fancy, you can include this CSS to pretty
up your page a bit.

What to turn in
---------------

Turn in screenshots of `docker ps` showing your running containers
along with a screenshot of your "Hello World" output from `curl`.
